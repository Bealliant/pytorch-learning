# 2021 Pytorch
As for me, this 2021 means so much. 

Right now, I cannot really recall very much of my memories, I just let them go, just float in the air.

In fact, I'm really a ridiculous person. I barely have any friends. 

In my Unversity, for some period of time, I have met two girls, when they sum up, you'll get a ten.

I don't know if I can persist doing all my research in 2022. This winter I was caught with Depression, Maybe Intermediate, I think.

Looking back to every line of code I wrote, that's what past *2021* gave me, I think.

The First time I sent an email to my Prof.

The First time I met them.

The Night we went out and have lots of fun.

The Day We Quarrel, and every conversation between us are so weird.

The Night I made it to run Neural Network, MINIST.

2022, I hope I can carry on.

I'm fine.
